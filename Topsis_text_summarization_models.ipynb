    "In this notebook we'll be using Text Summarization models from https://huggingface.co/models and apply them on 5 different text snippets in 3 different Domains (Politics, Medicine, Sports).\n",
    "\n",
    "To check model performance we'll be using following metrics/parameters:\n",
    "#### BLEU Score: \n",
    "BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of machine-generated text, commonly used in machine translation. It measures the precision of the generated text by comparing it to one or more reference texts.\n",
    "#### BERTScore: \n",
    "BERT Score is a metric that assesses the quality of machine-generated text by comparing it to reference texts. It employs pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models to capture semantic similarity and evaluates the text on multiple levels of granularity.\n",
    "#### METEOR Score:\n",
    "METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) is a metric for evaluating the quality of machine-generated text, particularly in machine translation. It considers precision, recall, and aligns the generated text with reference texts while also incorporating stemming and synonymy matching.\n",
    "#### Jaccard Similarity: \n",
    "Jaccard Similarity measures the similarity between two sets by comparing the intersection and union of their elements. In natural language processing, it's often used to evaluate the similarity of two texts by considering the overlapping words.\n",
    "#### Flesch Reading Ease: \n",
    "Flesch Reading Ease is a readability metric that assesses the complexity of written text. It provides a score based on the average sentence length and the average number of syllables per word, indicating how easy or difficult the text is to comprehend. Higher scores suggest easier readability."
